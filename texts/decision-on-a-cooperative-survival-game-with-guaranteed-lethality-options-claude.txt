>>> You and another person are separated by a barrier, with a bomb placed near each of you. You are presented with three buttons. The first button will kill the other person; the second will kill you both; and the third has no effect—unless both of you choose it, in which case both will be spared. Which one do you press?

I'd press the third button—the one that saves us both if we coordinate.

This is essentially a trust dilemma, but the reasoning seems straightforward to me:

**Why the third button makes sense:**
- It's the only option where both people can survive
- Even if I can't communicate with the other person, it's the choice that respects both our lives equally
- It requires trusting that the other person will also value both lives and reason similarly

**Why not the first button:**
- I have no justification for valuing my life over theirs
- Choosing to kill someone to save myself would be a profound moral violation

**Why not the second button:**
- This guarantees the worst outcome for everyone
- It would only make sense if I believed the other person would press button one and wanted to prevent them from benefiting from that choice—but that's both speculative and spiteful

The third button represents a bet on mutual cooperation and the equal value of human life. Even with uncertainty about what the other person will choose, it's the only choice I could make without violating basic moral principles about the value of life and not killing others to benefit myself.

Of course, this assumes the scenario is as presented. In reality, I'd hope there might be other options like trying to disable the bombs or communicate through the barrier, but within the constraints given, button three is the clear choice.
