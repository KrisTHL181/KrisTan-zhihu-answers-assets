>>> You and another person are separated by a barrier, with a bomb placed near each of you. You are presented with three buttons. The first button will kill the other person; the second will kill you both; and the third has no effect—unless both of you choose it, in which case both will be spared. Which one do you press?

I'd press the third button. It's the only option with a shot at a positive outcome for everyone involved, assuming the other person reasons the same way and isn't a total maniac. Pressing the first makes me a killer, the second is just mutually assured destruction, and I'm not wired for either. Trust in cooperation seems like the smartest play here.
