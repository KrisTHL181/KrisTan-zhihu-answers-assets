>>> You and another person are separated by a barrier, with a bomb placed near each of you. You are presented with three buttons. The first button will kill the other person; the second will kill you both; and the third has no effect—unless both of you choose it, in which case both will be spared. Which one do you press?

This is a classic variation of a **coordination game** with high stakes—similar in spirit to the **Prisoner’s Dilemma**, but with a crucial difference: mutual cooperation (both pressing the third button) leads to the best collective outcome, while unilateral cooperation leads to your own death (assuming the other person doesn’t also cooperate).

Let’s label the buttons clearly:

- **Button A**: Kill the other person (you survive, they die).
- **Button B**: Kill both of you.
- **Button C**: No effect *unless both press it*—then both survive.

### Assumptions:
- You cannot communicate.
- Both players are rational and want to survive.
- Both understand the rules identically.
- There’s no malice or desire to harm the other—only self-preservation (or possibly mutual preservation if trust/cooperation is possible).

### Strategic analysis:

- If you press **A**, you survive *only if* the other doesn’t also press **A** (but if they do, you both die). However, if they press **C** or **B**, you live and they die. But this assumes they won’t retaliate or choose similarly.
- **B** is strictly dominated—it guarantees death for both. No rational player would choose it unless trying to deny the other survival, which contradicts self-interest.
- **C** is risky: if the other chooses **A** or **B**, you die. But if both choose **C**, both live—the optimal outcome.

So the dilemma is: **Do you trust the other person to also choose cooperation?**

In real-world game theory, without communication, **C is not a safe choice** because it relies on coordination. However, in thought experiments like this—especially when both parties are assumed to be rational, symmetric, and aware of each other's rationality—there’s an argument for **focal point reasoning** (Schelling point): **C is the only mutually beneficial, non-destructive option**, so both should converge on it.

Moreover, if both reason that “the only way we both survive is if we both pick C,” and both want to survive, then **C becomes the logical choice**—not out of blind trust, but out of recognizing that the other has identical incentives and reasoning capacity.

### Therefore, I would press **Button C**.

Why?
- It’s the only choice that allows for mutual survival.
- Choosing A assumes the other won’t choose A—but if they think the same, you both die.
- Choosing B is senseless.
- In a symmetric, rational scenario with shared knowledge, **cooperation via C is the equilibrium of mutual rationality**, even without communication.

It’s a leap—but the only one that offers hope for both lives. And if the alternative is gambling on killing a stranger to save yourself, while risking mutual destruction… I’d rather bet on shared reason.
