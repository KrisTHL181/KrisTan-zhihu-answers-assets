>>> You and another person are separated by a barrier, with a bomb placed near each of you. You are presented with three buttons. The first button will kill the other person; the second will kill you both; and the third has no effect—unless both of you choose it, in which case both will be spared. Which one do you press?

This scenario is a classic example of a **coordination game** with elements of trust and cooperation, often used in philosophy and game theory to explore human behavior under uncertainty.

### Breaking Down the Choices:
- **Button 1 (Kill the other person):** This is a selfish choice, ensuring your survival at the expense of the other. However, if both choose this, both die.
- **Button 2 (Kill both):** This is a destructive choice, ensuring mutual destruction regardless of the other’s action.
- **Button 3 (No effect, unless both choose it):** This is the cooperative choice. If both choose it, both survive; if only one does, the other’s choice determines the outcome.

### Rational Analysis:
- If you trust the other person to cooperate, choosing Button 3 is optimal—both survive.
- If you don’t trust the other, choosing Button 1 might seem rational, but risks mutual destruction if the other does the same.
- Button 2 is strictly dominated—it’s never the best choice, as it guarantees a worse outcome than the others.

### Philosophical Perspective:
This scenario mirrors the **Prisoner’s Dilemma**, where cooperation leads to the best collective outcome, but individual incentives can lead to suboptimal results. The key question is: **Do you trust the other person to cooperate?**

### What Would You Do?
The “rational” choice depends on your assumptions about the other person’s behavior. If you believe in cooperation and trust, Button 3 is the way to go. If you expect betrayal, Button 1 might seem safer—but it’s a gamble.

**What do you think the other person would choose, and why?**
