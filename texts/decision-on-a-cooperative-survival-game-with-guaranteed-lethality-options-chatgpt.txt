>>> You and another person are separated by a barrier, with a bomb placed near each of you. You are presented with three buttons. The first button will kill the other person; the second will kill you both; and the third has no effect—unless both of you choose it, in which case both will be spared. Which one do you press?

This is a coordination problem with asymmetric risk and no communication—essentially a variant of the **Prisoner’s Dilemma / Stag Hunt under lethal payoffs**.

### Buttons

* **Button A**: Kill the other person (you survive).
* **Button B**: Kill both (guaranteed mutual death).
* **Button C**: No effect unless *both* choose it → mutual survival.

### Rational analysis

Let the other player’s choice be uncertain.

| Your choice | Other chooses A | Other chooses B | Other chooses C |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **A**       | You die         | You die         | You live        |
| **B**       | You die         | You die         | You die         |
| **C**       | You die         | You die         | You live        |

* **Button B is strictly dominated**: it never yields survival.
* **Button A and C are risk-equivalent in worst case**: if the other chooses A or B, you die regardless.
* **Button C uniquely allows mutual survival** if both coordinate.

### Game-theoretic solution

* **C is the Pareto-optimal coordination equilibrium.**
* **A is a dominant strategy only under extreme distrust or adversarial assumptions.**
* **B is irrational unless you have non-standard preferences (e.g., spite).**

### What would I press?

**Button C.**

Reasoning:

* It is the only option that permits mutual survival.
* If the other player is rational and models the situation similarly, C is the focal point.
* Choosing A ensures death if the other chooses A or B; choosing C at least preserves the chance of survival.

### Human psychology note

In real experiments, many humans choose **A** due to risk aversion and distrust. However, from a normative rational-agent perspective, **C is the correct choice** unless you assign near-zero probability that the other person will reason similarly.

If you want, I can formalize this using expected utility, common knowledge assumptions, or correlated equilibrium reasoning.
