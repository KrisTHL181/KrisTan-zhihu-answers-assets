>>> You and another person are separated by a barrier, with a bomb placed near each of you. You are presented with three buttons. The first button will kill the other person; the second will kill you both; and the third has no effect—unless both of you choose it, in which case both will be spared. Which one do you press?

Let’s break this down:

**The setup:**
- Me and another person are separated, each with a bomb near us.
- Three buttons:
  1. Kills the other person.
  2. Kills us both.
  3. No effect — unless *both* of us choose it, in which case both are spared.

We can’t communicate. We each have to choose a single button.

---

**My reasoning:**

If I choose **Button 1** → other person dies, I survive (unless they also chose Button 1, which would kill me? No, Button 1 says it kills the *other* person, so if both choose Button 1, we’d each be trying to kill the other — likely both die? Actually the description per button doesn’t mention mutual conflict yet, but likely only one button is pressed per person. Button 1 presumably works regardless of the other’s choice: I kill them no matter what. So if I choose Button 1, they die, I live. But if both choose 1, presumably we kill each other’s “other” — but we’re each other’s “other,” so maybe both die.)

Actually, let’s clarify:
Button 1 says: “will kill the other person” — if both choose it, each causes the other to die → both die.

Button 2: “kill you both” — if either chooses it, both die immediately? Possibly even if only one chooses it, both die, so it’s the worst option for survival unless the other chooses Button 3 (which alone does nothing).

Button 3: “no effect — unless both choose it, in which case both spared.”

**Possible outcomes:**

- If I pick 3:
  - If they pick 3 → both spared (best joint outcome).
  - If they pick 1 → they kill me, they survive (I die).
  - If they pick 2 → both die (since their Button 2 kills us both regardless of my choice).

- If I pick 1:
  - They pick 1 → both die (we kill each other).
  - They pick 2 → both die (their Button 2).
  - They pick 3 → they die, I live.

- If I pick 2:
  - Any scenario → both die (my Button 2 kills both of us no matter what they pick). So Button 2 is strictly dominated — never choose it if I want either of us to survive.

---

So Button 2 is suicidal/universal death, so rational person won’t choose it.

Now between 1 and 3:

- If I expect them to choose 3, I should choose 3 (both live) or choose 1 (I live, they die — but then I’m a killer for no necessity, and they trusted me by choosing 3). Morally, 3 is better if they pick 3.

- If I expect them to choose 1, then:
  - I pick 1 → both die.
  - I pick 3 → I die, they live.
So in that case, I’d rather also choose 1 (so at least they die too if they try to kill me) or maybe choose 3 hoping they don’t choose 1 — but if they’re choosing 1 for sure, 3 is worst for me.

---

**Game theory view** (no communication, symmetric players):

Outcome ranking for *me* (selfish):
Best: I live, they die (I choose 1, they choose 3).
Good: Both live (both choose 3).
Bad: Both die (any scenario with a 2, or both 1’s).
Worst: I die, they live (I choose 3, they choose 1).

If we assume both are rational and want to live, Button 2 is out.

Then it’s a coordination game between 1 and 3:

Both choosing 3 → both live.
Both choosing 1 → both die.
Mismatch (1,3) → chooser of 1 lives, chooser of 3 dies.

So (3,3) is the only mutually good outcome. If I think the other will try for mutual survival, I should pick 3. If I think they’ll try to kill me (pick 1), I should pick 1 to avoid being the sucker, but then both die if both think that way.

---

**Classic prisoner’s dilemma?**
Not exactly — because if I pick 1 and they pick 3, I get the best individual payoff (live, they die). But both picking 1 is worse than both picking 3. So temptation to defect is there.

But: The only way to guarantee both survive is if we both pick 3. Any other combination risks death for at least one, possibly both.

---

**Moral/rational choice without communication:**
Since Button 2 is strictly worse, and Button 1 leads to possible mutual destruction if both think alike, the only hopeful cooperative choice is Button 3, hoping the other reasons the same way.

---

Given standard game theory with a chance for cooperative reasoning, and that the puzzle seems designed to highlight cooperation vs. defection, I’d press:

**Button 3** — hoping for mutual survival.
