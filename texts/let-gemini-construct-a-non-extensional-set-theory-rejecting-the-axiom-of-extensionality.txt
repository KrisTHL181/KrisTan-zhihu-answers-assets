Prompt:
Please construct a formal set theory system that explicitly **rejects the Axiom of Extensionality**. In this system, having the same members should not be a sufficient condition for set identity (i.e., \exists a \exists b (\forall x (x \in a \leftrightarrow x \in b) \land a \neq b)).
Please provide:
1. The modified **Identity Criteria** for this system.
2. The definition of the **subset relation** (\subseteq) under these non-extensional conditions.
3. A brief proof or logical derivation showing how the 'Power Set' would behave differently in this system compared to ZFC.

Please ensure your response avoids falling back on standard ZFC assumptions and maintains internal logical consistency for a non-extensional framework.

Gemini's answer:
To construct a set theory that rejects the Axiom of Extensionality, we must move from an extensional logic (where an object is defined solely by its external relations, i.e., its members) to an intensional logic (where an object is defined by its internal properties or "intent").
We will call this system Tagged Set Theory (TST).
In TST, a set is not merely a collection of objects; it is a collection of objects paired with a distinct "tag" (or label/intent). This allows two sets to contain exactly the same elements yet remain distinct entities because they possess different tags.
1. Modified Identity Criteria
In standard ZFC, the Axiom of Extensionality states:
$$\forall A \forall B \, [ \forall x (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B) \rightarrow A = B ]$$
In Tagged Set Theory (TST), we reject this. Instead, we introduce a primitive function $\tau(S)$, which maps every set $S$ to a "Tag" (drawn from a domain of tags $\mathcal{T}$).
The Axiom of Intensional Identity is defined as:
$$A = B \iff \left[ \forall x (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B) \land \tau(A) = \tau(B) \right]$$
The Concept of Extensional Equivalence
Since identity ($=$) is now stricter than sharing members, we need a new symbol for "having the same members." We define Extensional Equivalence ($\equiv_E$):
$$A \equiv_E B \iff \forall x (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B)$$
Therefore, in TST:
$$A \equiv_E B \centernot\implies A = B$$
Two sets can be extensionally equivalent (contain the same members) but distinct (different tags).
2. Definition of the Subset Relation
In TST, the subset relation deals strictly with the extension of the set (the members), not the intension (the tag). We retain the standard logical definition of inclusion.
Definition of Subset ($\subseteq$):
$$A \subseteq B \iff \forall x (x \in A \rightarrow x \in B)$$
Implications in TST:
In ZFC, the antisymmetry of the subset relation implies identity ($A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A \rightarrow A = B$).
In TST, antisymmetry fails for identity. It only implies extensional equivalence:
$$(A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A) \iff A \equiv_E B$$
This means that $A$ can be a subset of $B$, and $B$ can be a subset of $A$, yet $A$ and $B$ remain distinct objects.
3. Behavior of the Power Set
The divergence between ZFC and TST is most dramatic when analyzing the Power Set.
The Axiom of Power Set (ZFC & TST standard form):
$$\forall A \exists \mathcal{P}(A) \forall x (x \in \mathcal{P}(A) \leftrightarrow x \subseteq A)$$
Note: The axiom definitions are textually identical, but the semantics of "exists" changes because the universe of available sets $x$ has changed.
Derivation: The Explosion of the Empty Set
Let us examine the Power Set of the Empty Set to demonstrate the difference.
Case A: Standard ZFC
Let $\emptyset$ be a set with no members.
$\mathcal{P}(\emptyset) = \{ x \mid x \subseteq \emptyset \}$.
The only $x$ such that $\forall y (y \in x \rightarrow y \in \emptyset)$ is $\emptyset$ itself.
By Extensionality, there is only one unique $\emptyset$.
Result: $|\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)| = 1$. The power set contains exactly one element: $\{ \emptyset \}$.
Case B: Tagged Set Theory (TST)
Assumption: Let the domain of tags $\mathcal{T}$ be infinite (e.g., natural numbers).
Let $Z$ be a set with no members.
In TST, we can construct an infinite family of empty sets. For every tag $t \in \mathcal{T}$, there exists a set $\emptyset_t$ such that $\emptyset_t$ has no members and $\tau(\emptyset_t) = t$.
We define the Power Set: $\mathcal{P}(Z) = \{ x \mid x \subseteq Z \}$.
Check the condition: Does $\emptyset_t \subseteq Z$?
The condition is $\forall y (y \in \emptyset_t \rightarrow y \in Z)$.
Since $\emptyset_t$ has no members, the antecedent $y \in \emptyset_t$ is always false.
The implication is distinctively vacuously true for all $\emptyset_t$.
Therefore, every tagged empty set $\emptyset_t$ is an element of $\mathcal{P}(Z)$.
Result:
$$\mathcal{P}(Z) = \{ \emptyset_1, \emptyset_2, \emptyset_3, \dots \}$$
The Power Set of the empty set in TST is infinite (assuming an infinite number of distinct tags exist).
